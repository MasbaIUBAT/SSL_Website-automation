To learn the skills necessary to understand and modify the given shell script over a span of 4 days, you can break it down into specific learning goals and topics. Here's a structured syllabus:

### Day 1: Basics of Shell Scripting and Linux Commands

#### **Morning: Introduction to Shell Scripting**

1. **What is Shell Scripting?**
   - Overview of shell scripts and their uses.
   - Basic syntax and structure of shell scripts.

2. **Basic Commands and Operations**
   - Learn how to use common commands: `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `echo`.
   - Understand file permissions and how to use `chmod`.

3. **Creating and Running Shell Scripts**
   - Writing a simple shell script: `#!/bin/bash`, `echo "Hello World"`.
   - Making a script executable: `chmod +x script.sh`.
   - Running a script: `./script.sh`.

#### **Afternoon: Variables, Conditionals, and Loops**

1. **Variables and Strings**
   - Declaring and using variables: `VAR=value`, `echo $VAR`.
   - String operations: concatenation, substring extraction.

2. **Conditionals**
   - Using `if`, `else`, `elif` for decision making.
   - Understanding comparison operators: `-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-gt`, `-ge`, `-le`.

3. **Loops**
   - Basic loop structures: `for`, `while`, `until`.
   - Example: `for i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done`.

#### **Evening: Practice and Exercises**

- Write simple scripts using variables, conditionals, and loops.
- Practice file operations and permissions.

### Day 2: Advanced Shell Scripting and Tools

#### **Morning: File Operations and Redirection**

1. **File Handling**
   - Reading from and writing to files: `cat`, `echo`, `>>`, `>`.

2. **Redirection and Pipelines**
   - Using `>` and `>>` for output redirection.
   - Piping output with `|`: `command1 | command2`.

#### **Afternoon: Text Processing Tools**

1. **Text Manipulation Tools**
   - `grep`: Searching for patterns.
   - `awk`: Field processing and pattern scanning.
   - `sed`: Stream editing for text substitution.

2. **Practical Exercises**
   - Practice using `grep`, `awk`, and `sed` with sample data.

#### **Evening: Introduction to Networking Commands**

1. **Basic Networking Commands**
   - Understanding `curl` for web requests.
   - Introduction to `openssl` for SSL certificate checks.

2. **Practical Exercises**
   - Use `curl` to check HTTP status codes.
   - Use `openssl` to inspect SSL certificates.

### Day 3: Scripting with Network and SSL Checks

#### **Morning: Writing Scripts for Network Operations**

1. **Scripting with `curl` and `openssl`**
   - Using `curl` to check if a site is up or down.
   - Extracting and parsing SSL certificate expiry dates using `openssl`.

2. **Practical Exercises**
   - Write a script to check HTTP status codes and SSL expiry.

#### **Afternoon: Script Analysis and Modification**

1. **Understanding the Provided Script**
   - Break down the script: input files, loops, conditionals, and commands used.
   - Understand how the script handles SSL certificate checks and website status.

2. **Modify and Extend the Script**
   - Add features like logging or additional error handling.
   - Modify the script to include more detailed reports.

#### **Evening: Debugging and Testing**

1. **Debugging Techniques**
   - Use `set -x` for debugging scripts.
   - Understand common errors and how to resolve them.

2. **Testing**
   - Test the script with different input scenarios.
   - Verify output files and results.

### Day 4: Final Project and Best Practices

#### **Morning: Final Project**

1. **Integrate Learnings**
   - Write a comprehensive script that combines file operations, network checks, and SSL certificate verification.
   - Implement error handling and logging.

2. **Document Your Script**
   - Add comments to explain each part of the script.
   - Create documentation for how to use the script.

#### **Afternoon: Best Practices and Deployment**

1. **Best Practices in Shell Scripting**
   - Script organization and readability.
   - Security considerations: avoid hardcoding sensitive information.

2. **Deployment and Automation**
   - Automate script execution using cron jobs or systemd timers.
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage and track script changes.

#### **Evening: Review and Reflection**

1. **Review**
   - Go over what you have learned and achieved.
   - Test the final project script in different scenarios.

2. **Reflection**
   - Reflect on areas for further learning and improvement.
   - Explore additional resources or advanced topics.

This syllabus will guide you through the essential steps to understand and work with the provided shell script, from basic concepts to advanced scripting techniques.
